Here we discuss the usage of the package `AdditionalExercisePackage`.

```{r setup}
library(AdditionalExercisePackage)
```

The package consists of the function `` `%r%` `` that returns coefficients of a linear model (check documentation with `?%r%` for more details) and the class Person_class that stores information of a person with its method print_info that prints its information.

In addition, the package íncludes the dataset `snipes.csv` that stores prices for popular boot brands.
